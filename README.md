# Unexpected Type Coercion in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion.  The `myFunction` adds a number and a string, resulting in unexpected string concatenation instead of numerical addition.  The solution showcases how to avoid this issue using strict type checking or explicit type conversion.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file contains a function that unintentionally performs string concatenation due to JavaScript's loose typing.
